                <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
                <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
                    <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
                </ul>

            <header>JavaScript and Java</header>
            <article>
                <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
                <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>
                <p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.</p>
            </article>

        <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
            <header>Variables</header>
            <article>
                <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
                <p>With the keyword var. For example,</p>
                <code>var x = 42.</code>
            </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Global_variables">
            <header>Global variables</header>
            <article>
                <p>Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global variables using the window.variable syntax. <br></br> Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.</p>
            </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Constants">
            <header>Constants</header>
            <article>
                <p>You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.</p>
                <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
                <p>A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.</p>
                <p>The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable.</p>
                <p>You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope. For example:</p>
                <code>// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR
                    function f() {};
                    const f = 5;</code>
                <p>However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement is executed without problems.</p>
                <code>const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key = "otherValue";</code>
            </article>

        <section class="main-section" id="Data_types">
            <header>Data types</header>
            <article>
                <p>The latest ECMAScipt standard defines seven data types:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Six data types that are primitives:</li>
                    <ul id="primitives">
                        <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                        <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.</li>
                        <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
                        <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                        <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
                        <li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 6). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>and Object</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that your application can perform.</p>
            </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Functions">
                <header>Functions</header>
                <article>
                    <p>Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. It can take input, called parameters, and return a value.</p>
                    <p>To define a function, you can use the function keyword followed by the function name and a pair of parentheses. Inside the parentheses, you can specify any parameters that the function should accept.</p>
                    <code>function add(a, b) {
                        return a + b;
                    }</code>
                    <p>To call a function, you simply write the function name followed by a pair of parentheses. If the function has parameters, you can pass values inside the parentheses.</p>
                    <code>var result = add(5, 3);</code>
                    <p>The result variable will now hold the value 8.</p>
                </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Arrays">
                <header>Arrays</header>
                <article>
                    <p>An array is a data structure that allows you to store multiple values in a single variable. Each value in the array is called an element, and each element is assigned a unique index starting from 0.</p>
                    <p>To create an array, you can use square brackets and separate the elements with commas.</p>
                    <code>var fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];</code>
                    <p>You can access individual elements in an array using their index. For example, to access the second element in the fruits array:</p>
                    <code>var secondFruit = fruits[1]; // "banana"</code>
                    <p>You can also modify elements in an array by assigning a new value to a specific index.</p>
                    <code>fruits[0] = "pear"; // ["pear", "banana", "orange"]</code>
                </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Loops">
                <header>Loops</header>
                <article>
                    <p>Loops are used to repeatedly execute a block of code until a certain condition is met. JavaScript provides several types of loops, including the for loop, while loop, and do-while loop.</p>
                    <p>The for loop is commonly used when you know the number of iterations in advance. It consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and increment.</p>
                    <code>for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                        console.log(i);
                    }</code>
                    <p>This loop will print the numbers 0 to 4.</p>
                    <p>The while loop is used when you don't know the number of iterations in advance but have a condition that needs to be checked before each iteration.</p>
                    <code>var i = 0;
                    while (i < 5) {
                        console.log(i);
                        i++;
                    }</code>
                    <p>This loop will also print the numbers 0 to 4.</p>
                    <p>The do-while loop is similar to the while loop, but the condition is checked after each iteration. This guarantees that the loop will execute at least once.</p>
                    <code>var i = 0;
                    do {
                        console.log(i);
                        i++;
                    } while (i < 5);</code>
                    <p>This loop will also print the numbers 0 to 4.</p>
